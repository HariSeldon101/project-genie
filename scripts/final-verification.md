# Project Genie - Final Verification Steps

## Database Migration Status
✅ Migration SQL script provided to user
✅ User confirmed: "I have run the script"
✅ Service role can create projects (verified)
⚠️  RLS policies need to be confirmed via Supabase Dashboard

## Deployment Status
✅ Code pushed to GitHub
✅ Deployed to Vercel successfully
✅ Production URL: https://project-genie-one.vercel.app

## Testing Checklist

### 1. Authentication Flow
- [ ] Go to https://project-genie-one.vercel.app
- [ ] Click "Sign In" 
- [ ] Sign in with Google OAuth
- [ ] Verify redirect to dashboard

### 2. Project Creation
- [ ] Navigate to https://project-genie-one.vercel.app/projects/new
- [ ] Fill in project details:
  - Name: Test Project
  - Description: Testing after migration
  - Methodology: Agile
  - RAG Status: Green
- [ ] Click "Create Project"
- [ ] Verify project is created successfully

### 3. Database Verification
If project creation still fails:

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/vnuieavheezjxbkyfxea
2. Click "SQL Editor"
3. Run this verification query:
```sql
-- Check existing policies
SELECT * FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'projects' 
AND schemaname = 'public';

-- Check table columns
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'projects'
AND table_schema = 'public';
```

4. If policies are missing, re-run the migration:
```sql
-- Drop ALL existing policies on projects table
DO $$ 
DECLARE
    pol record;
BEGIN
    FOR pol IN 
        SELECT policyname 
        FROM pg_policies 
        WHERE tablename = 'projects' 
        AND schemaname = 'public'
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON public.projects', pol.policyname);
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- Add missing columns
ALTER TABLE public.projects 
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS status TEXT DEFAULT 'planning',
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS company_info JSONB,
    ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS progress INTEGER DEFAULT 0;

-- Create working policies
CREATE POLICY "enable_insert_for_authenticated_users" ON public.projects
    FOR INSERT 
    TO authenticated
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = owner_id);

CREATE POLICY "enable_select_for_owners" ON public.projects
    FOR SELECT 
    TO authenticated
    USING (auth.uid() = owner_id);

CREATE POLICY "enable_update_for_owners" ON public.projects
    FOR UPDATE 
    TO authenticated
    USING (auth.uid() = owner_id)
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = owner_id);

CREATE POLICY "enable_delete_for_owners" ON public.projects
    FOR DELETE 
    TO authenticated
    USING (auth.uid() = owner_id);
```

## Known Issues Resolved
- ✅ OAuth redirect URLs updated for both localhost and production
- ✅ Edge runtime issues fixed by removing from layouts
- ✅ Database migration script provided
- ✅ Deployment successful

## Next Steps
1. User should test the application at https://project-genie-one.vercel.app
2. If issues persist, check Supabase Dashboard for policy status
3. Monitor for any new errors in production
