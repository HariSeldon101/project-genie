## 1\. Executive Summary

The Digital Banking Transformation Initiative project aims to deliver key business value through strategic initiatives. Key objectives include Achieve PSD2 compliance by Q3 2024 and Reduce operational costs by 35% by end of 2025. Major deliverables encompass Open Banking APIs and Mobile Customer Portal.

## 2\. Project Background

The Digital Banking Transformation Initiative aims to address the urgent need for modernization of our legacy banking systems in response to regulatory pressures such as the Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD2) and to enhance our competitive positioning in the digital banking sector. As a leading financial institution, we recognize the necessity to adopt advanced technologies that not only comply with regulatory requirements but also improve customer experience and operational efficiency.

## 3\. Project Definition

### 3.1 Objectives

-   Achieve PSD2 compliance by Q3 2024
-   Reduce operational costs by 35% by end of 2025
-   Increase customer acquisition by 45% within 12 months post-implementation
-   Ensure zero downtime during the migration of 2.3 million customer accounts
-   Implement AI-driven fraud detection systems by end of project.

### 3.2 Scope

#### In Scope:

-   Implementation of open banking APIs
-   Real-time payment processing capabilities
-   Enhanced KYC/AML procedures
-   Development of a mobile-first customer portal
-   AI-driven fraud detection systems
-   Migration of 2.3 million customer accounts with zero downtime

#### Out of Scope:

-   Legacy system maintenance post-migration
-   Development of non-digital banking services
-   Changes to existing physical branch operations

### 3.3 Deliverables

-   Open Banking APIs
-   Mobile Customer Portal
-   Real-time Payment Processing System

### 3.4 Constraints

-   Regulatory compliance deadline of Q3 2024
-   Budget limitations of £12M
-   Zero downtime requirement during customer migration

### 3.5 Assumptions

-   All stakeholders will provide timely feedback
-   Necessary technology resources will be available
-   Regulatory requirements will not change during the project

### 3.7 Interfaces

-   Integration with existing banking systems
-   Collaboration with third-party API providers
-   Coordination with regulatory bodies for compliance checks

## 4\. Business Case

### 4.1 Reasons for the Project

The Digital Banking Transformation Initiative is essential for regulatory compliance with PSD2, which mandates significant changes to banking operations and infrastructure. Failure to comply could result in fines of up to 4% of annual turnover, which is approximately £2.4M based on last year's revenue.

### 4.2 Business Options

#### Do Nothing

Maintain current legacy systems without upgrades or changes.

**Benefits:** No initial investment required, but high risk of regulatory fines and operational inefficiencies.

**Costs:** £0

**Risks:** Non-compliance with PSD2 leading to fines and loss of customers.

#### Partial Upgrade

Implement some digital features while retaining legacy systems.

**Benefits:** Reduced initial investment but limited operational improvements and continued compliance risk.

**Costs:** £5M

**Risks:** Inability to fully meet PSD2 requirements.

#### Full Transformation (Recommended)

Complete overhaul of banking infrastructure ensuring compliance and modern features.

**Benefits:** Full compliance with PSD2, operational cost reduction, and enhanced customer acquisition.

**Costs:** £12M

**Risks:** High initial investment but mitigated by long-term savings and revenue generation.

### 4.3 Expected Benefits

-   Regulatory compliance avoiding fines
-   Operational cost savings
-   Increased customer acquisition
