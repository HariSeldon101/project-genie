-- EMERGENCY FIX: Complete RLS Reset
-- This script completely removes and rebuilds RLS policies to fix infinite recursion

-- PART 1: DISABLE ALL RLS (Run this first)
ALTER TABLE projects DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE project_members DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE stakeholders DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE tasks DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE risks DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE artifacts DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE activity_log DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- PART 2: DROP ALL EXISTING POLICIES
DO $$ 
DECLARE
    pol record;
BEGIN
    -- Drop all policies on projects
    FOR pol IN SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'projects'
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON projects', pol.policyname);
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Drop all policies on project_members
    FOR pol IN SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'project_members'
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON project_members', pol.policyname);
    END LOOP;
    
    -- Drop all policies on other tables
    FOR pol IN SELECT policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename IN ('stakeholders', 'tasks', 'risks', 'artifacts', 'activity_log')
    LOOP
        EXECUTE format('DROP POLICY IF EXISTS %I ON %I', pol.policyname, pol.tablename);
    END LOOP;
END $$;

-- PART 3: CREATE MINIMAL WORKING POLICIES

-- Projects: Users can only see and manage their own projects
CREATE POLICY "projects_owner_all" ON projects
    FOR ALL
    USING (auth.uid() = owner_id)
    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = owner_id);

-- Enable RLS on projects
ALTER TABLE projects ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- For now, leave other tables without RLS to avoid complications
-- You can add more sophisticated policies later

-- PART 4: GRANT PERMISSIONS
GRANT ALL ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO authenticated;

-- PART 5: Create helper function for testing
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_project_access(project_uuid UUID)
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM projects 
        WHERE id = project_uuid 
        AND owner_id = auth.uid()
    );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Output confirmation
SELECT 'RLS policies have been reset. Projects table now has simple owner-only access.' as status;
