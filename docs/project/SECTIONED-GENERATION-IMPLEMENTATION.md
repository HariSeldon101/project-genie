# Sectioned Document Generation Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented a sectioned approach for generating large PRINCE2 documents (PID and Business Case) to prevent JSON truncation issues.

## Problem Solved
- **Issue**: PID and Business Case documents were being stored with incomplete/truncated JSON
- **Root Cause**: Large JSON responses were being truncated during generation
- **Solution**: Generate documents in smaller sections and combine them

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Migration (Completed)
- Content column is already JSONB type in database
- Properly handles large JSON documents

### 2. Sectioned Generator (`lib/documents/sectioned-generator.ts`)
Created a new generator that:
- Splits PID generation into 4 sections:
  - Section 1: Project Definition & Business Case
  - Section 2: Organization Structure  
  - Section 3: Management Approaches (Quality, Config, Risk, Communication)
  - Section 4: Project Plan & Controls
- Splits Business Case generation into 4 sections:
  - Section 1: Executive Summary & Reasons
  - Section 2: Business Options
  - Section 3: Benefits & Disbenefits
  - Section 4: Financials & Risks
- Each section has fallback defaults if generation fails
- Combines all sections into complete JSON document

### 3. Updated Document Generator
- Modified `generatePrince2PID()` to use `SectionedDocumentGenerator`
- Modified `generateBusinessCase()` to use `SectionedDocumentGenerator`
- Both methods now generate complete, valid JSON structures

### 4. Validation & Testing
- Created test script: `test-sectioned-generation.ts`
- Validates all required sections are present
- Test Results: ✅ ALL TESTS PASS
  - PID: All 10 sections present
  - Business Case: All 9 sections present

## Files Modified
1. `/lib/documents/sectioned-generator.ts` - New sectioned generator
2. `/lib/documents/generator.ts` - Updated PID and Business Case methods
3. `/lib/documents/formatters/document-formatter-utils.ts` - Helper functions
4. `/test-sectioned-generation.ts` - Test script

## Benefits
1. **Complete JSON Generation**: No more truncated documents
2. **Reliable Structure**: All required sections guaranteed
3. **Error Recovery**: Fallback defaults for failed sections
4. **Better Performance**: Smaller prompts = faster generation
5. **Maintainable**: Easy to add/modify sections

## Next Steps
1. Deploy to production
2. Monitor document generation completeness
3. Consider applying sectioned approach to other large documents if needed

## Testing
Run the test with:
```bash
npx tsx test-sectioned-generation.ts
```

Expected output:
- PID Generation: ✅ PASSED
- Business Case Generation: ✅ PASSED
- All sections present in both documents
