## **1\. Introduction**

### **1.1. Overview**

Project Genie is a next-generation, AI-powered SaaS platform designed to serve as an intelligent co-pilot for professional project managers. It streamlines the creation, management, and refinement of project documentation by dynamically generating artifacts tailored to specific methodologies like Prince2, Agile, and hybrid models. By leveraging a conversational AI interface, predictive analytics, and agentic tools, Project Genie aims to significantly reduce administrative overhead, enhance decision-making, and allow project managers to focus on high-impact strategic work.

### **1.2. Problem Statement**

Professional project managers are often burdened by the high administrative overhead required to create and maintain methodology-specific documentation. Existing project management tools are either too rigid, forcing users to adapt their workflow to the software, or too flexible, offering generic templates that lack deep methodological understanding.\[5, 65\] This results in a "Methodology Tax"—time spent on manual document creation, cross-referencing, and ensuring consistency, which detracts from strategic project execution. Furthermore, stakeholders lack a simple, predictive, and high-level view of project health, as current RAG (Red, Amber, Green) reporting tools are often simplistic and reactive.\[23, 66\]

### **1.3. Goals & Objectives**

* **Primary Goal:** To create a SaaS platform that automates the generation of methodology-aware project documentation, reducing the administrative burden on project managers by at least 40%.  
* **Objective 1:** Develop a "Project Genesis Wizard" that allows users to select a methodology (Prince2, Agile, Hybrid) and input core project data to generate a complete set of initial documents within 5 minutes.  
* **Objective 2:** Implement a conversational AI chat interface that allows for the natural language querying, updating, and refinement of all project artifacts.  
* **Objective 3:** Build an intelligent, predictive RAG dashboard that provides stakeholders with a clear, actionable, and forward-looking overview of project health.  
* **Objective 4:** Integrate an LLM-powered research agent to provide project managers with contextual industry insights, risk analysis, and technology trends on demand.

### **1.4. Success Metrics & KPIs**

The success of Project Genie will be measured against the following Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

| Category | KPI | Benchmark (Year 1\) |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **User Engagement** | Daily Active Users (DAU) / Monthly Active Users (MAU) Ratio | \> 30% |
|  | Feature Adoption Rate (for AI Chat & RAG Dashboard) | \> 60% of active users |
| **Customer Success** | Customer Churn Rate (Monthly) | \< 5% \[67\] |

## **2\. User Personas**

### **2.1. Primary Persona: The Project Manager ("Priya")**

* **Role:** Senior Project Manager at a mid-sized tech consultancy.  
* **Goals:** Deliver complex projects on time and within budget; maintain high standards of governance and documentation (often using Prince2 or a hybrid approach); keep stakeholders informed and aligned.  
* **Frustrations:** Spends too much time creating and updating documents (PIDs, risk logs, status reports); struggles to keep disparate documents consistent; finds existing tools clunky and not tailored to her specific methodologies.  
* **Needs:** A tool that understands her methodology, automates document creation, simplifies updates, and provides intelligent insights into project risks.

### **2.2. Secondary Persona: The Stakeholder ("Steve")**

* **Role:** Director of Operations, member of the Project Board.  
* **Goals:** Understand the high-level health of key projects at a glance; make informed decisions about resource allocation and project continuation; avoid getting bogged down in technical details.  
* **Frustrations:** Status reports are often dense, outdated, or overly optimistic; it's hard to tell which projects are truly "at risk" versus just facing minor issues; meetings are inefficient.\[60\]  
* **Needs:** A simple, visual dashboard that clearly shows the current and *predicted* health of projects (RAG status) with the ability to drill down into the root causes of any issues.

* **User Story:** As Priya, I want to select my project methodology and input basic details like the project name, vision, and stakeholders, so the app can generate the initial documents for me.  
* **Requirements:**  
  * **Step 1: Methodology Selection:** A dropdown menu allowing the user to select 'Agile (Scrum)', 'Prince2', or 'Hybrid'.  
  * **Step 2: Core Inputs:** A single form to capture Project Name, Project Vision/Business Case, and Key Stakeholders.  
  * **Step 3 (Hybrid Only):** If 'Hybrid' is selected, the wizard will present the interactive **Prince2 Agilometer** to tailor the project framework.\[40, 41, 42, 43, 74, 75\]  
  * **Outcome:** Upon completion, the user is taken directly to the newly created project dashboard with generated documents.

### **3.3. Dynamic Document Generation Engine**

* **Description:** The core engine that takes user inputs and generates methodology-specific documents based on the user's selection in the Genesis Wizard.  
* **User Story:** As Priya, after completing the wizard for my new project, I want to see a pre-populated set of documents relevant to my chosen methodology (e.g., a PID for Prince2, a Charter for Agile) so I don't have to start from scratch.  
* **Requirements:**  
  * **Agile:** Generate an **Agile Project Charter** containing sections for Vision, Objectives, Scope, Stakeholders, and Preliminary Risks \[44, 45, 47, 48, 76\] and an initial **Product Backlog**.\[23, 43\]  
  * **Prince2:** Generate a **Prince2 Project Initiation Documentation (PID)** structure, including sections for the Business Case, Risk Register, Project Plan, and key Management Approaches.\[11, 12, 16, 49, 50, 54\]  
  * **Hybrid:** Generate a bespoke combination of artifacts based on the Agilometer assessment, such as a high-level PID combined with an Agile Product Backlog.\[37, 39, 77\]  
  * Documents are not static files but dynamic "views" of the central Supabase database.

### **3.4. Document & Project Views**

* **Description:** The primary interface for viewing and interacting with generated documents and project artifacts.  
* **User Story:** As Priya, I need to view my generated documents, such as my PID or Project Charter, manage my Backlog or Project Plan, and see progress on a Kanban or Gantt chart depending on my methodology.  
* **Requirements:**  
  * A clean, readable view for the Agile Project Charter.  
  * A structured, navigable view for the Prince2 PID and its component parts.  
  * A list-based view for the Product Backlog, allowing for drag-and-drop prioritization.  
  * A basic **Kanban Board** view with "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns for managing Agile work.  
  * A basic **Gantt Chart** view for Prince2/Hybrid project plans.  
  * A manually-set RAG status indicator (e.g., a simple status column) on the main project view to gather feedback for the full RAG dashboard.\[78\]

### **3.5. Conversational Command Interface (CCI) \- MVP Version**

* **Description:** A basic version of the AI chat interface, powered by the LLM Gateway, focused on core backlog and task management.  
* **User Story:** As Priya, I want to type commands like "add a user story to create a login page" or "log a new risk related to supplier delay" to quickly populate my project artifacts without using forms.  
* **Requirements:**  
  * A persistent chat input field in the UI.  
  * Natural Language Understanding (NLU) to parse commands for:  
    * Creating new user stories/tasks.  
    * Creating new risks in the Risk Register.  
    * Assigning tasks to team members.  
    * Setting due dates.  
  * The CCI will interact with the LLM Gateway, which will in turn update the Supabase backend.

## **4\. Post-MVP Features (Roadmap)**

### **4.1. Intelligent RAG Dashboard**

* **Description:** A portfolio-level dashboard providing a high-level overview of all projects.  
* **Requirements:**  
  * Visual RAG (Red, Amber, Green) indicators for each project.\[60\]  
  * **Configurable RAG Logic:** Allow admins to define the criteria for each status (e.g., Red if budget variance \> 15%).\[59\]  
  * **Predictive Status:** Use an AI agent (see 4.3) to forecast a project's future health status.  
  * **Drill-Down Analysis:** Clicking a Red/Amber status reveals AI-generated root cause analysis.

### **4.2. Full Conversational AI & LLM Research Co-Pilot**

* **Description:** Enhance the CCI to support querying, complex updates, and document refinement. Integrate the LLM research tool.  
* **Requirements:**  
  * **CCI:** Support queries ("Show me all high-impact risks") and refinements ("In the business case, elaborate on the ROI calculation").  
  * **LLM Research Co-Pilot:** An in-app agent that, given a project description, generates a research summary on common industry risks, relevant technologies, and market trends.

### **4.3. Embedded AI Agents**

* **Description:** Develop specialized, autonomous AI agents that work in the background to provide proactive insights.  
* **Requirements:**  
  * **Risk Sentinel Agent:** Continuously monitors project data to predict emerging risks and powers the predictive RAG status.\[62, 63, 64\]  
  * **Compliance Guardian Agent:** For Prince2/Hybrid projects, monitors adherence to governance, such as ensuring End Stage Reports are completed.\[79\]  
  * **Sprint Forecaster Agent:** For Agile projects, provides probabilistic forecasts for sprint completion based on historical team velocity.

### **4.4. Local LLM Integration**

* **Description:** Implement support for locally-hosted LLMs for enterprise customers with high data privacy and security needs.  
* **Requirements:**  
  * Extend the LLM Gateway to route requests to a local endpoint (e.g., an Ollama or LM Studio server).\[109, 110\]  
  * Provide documentation and configuration options for users to connect the platform to their own self-hosted LLM instances.

## **5\. Technical Specifications**

### **5.1. Architecture**

* **Framework:** Next.js 15 (App Router)  
* **Language:** TypeScript  
* **Backend & Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage)  
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS  
* **Animations:** Framer Motion  
* **Deployment:** Vercel via GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

### **5.2. UI Library Recommendation**

* **Primary Library:** **Shadcn UI**. It is not a traditional component library but a collection of reusable components that can be copied into the app's source code. This provides maximum control and customization while integrating perfectly with Next.js and Tailwind CSS. It is ideal for dashboards and admin panels.\[80, 81, 82\]  
* **Specialized Components:** For complex, data-heavy components like the **Gantt Chart** and advanced **Kanban Board**, we will integrate a dedicated enterprise-grade library such as **Syncfusion**. Syncfusion offers high-performance, feature-rich components with native support for Tailwind themes, virtual scrolling for large datasets, and seamless data binding required for our application.\[83, 84\] This hybrid approach leverages Shadcn for speed and consistency in standard UI elements and Syncfusion for robust, specialized functionality.

### **5.3. High-Level Database Schema (Supabase/PostgreSQL)**

* projects: id, name, description, methodology\_type, owner\_id  
* users: Standard Supabase auth users table.  
* project\_members: project\_id, user\_id, role  
* artifacts: id, project\_id, type (e.g., 'charter', 'pid', 'backlog'), content (JSONB)  
* tasks: id, project\_id, artifact\_id, title, description, status, assignee\_id, due\_date  
* risks: id, project\_id, description, impact, probability, mitigation\_plan  
* decisions: id, project\_id, description, decision\_date, outcome

*Note: Row Level Security (RLS) will be enabled on all tables to ensure users can only access data for projects they are members of.\[71\]*

### **5.4. AI/LLM Architecture**

* **LLM Gateway Pattern:** The application will use an LLM Gateway as a middleware layer between the application logic and the various LLM providers.\[105, 106, 107\] This gateway will provide a single, unified API for all AI functions, abstracting the specific implementations of different models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere).\[105\]  
* **Provider Agnosticism:** The architecture must be model-agnostic, allowing for the seamless swapping of LLM providers without requiring changes to the application's core code.\[106, 108\] This is crucial for optimizing cost, performance, and leveraging the best model for a given task.  
* **Prompt Management & Guardrails:** The LLM Gateway will be responsible for prompt engineering. It will receive simple, natural language input from the user via the UI, enrich it with relevant project context from the Supabase database, and construct a detailed, optimized prompt for the LLM. This process acts as a "guardrail," ensuring all queries are on-topic, secure, and contextually aware.  
* **Future-Proofing for Local LLMs:** The gateway design must anticipate future integration with locally-hosted LLMs. It should be capable of routing requests to either a cloud provider's API or a local network endpoint (e.g., an Ollama server).\[109, 110\] This provides a clear path for an on-premise solution for enterprise clients, addressing data privacy and security concerns by keeping all sensitive data within their own infrastructure.\[109\]

## **6\. UI/UX Design Guidelines**

### **6.1. Design Philosophy**

The UI should be modern, clean, and intuitive, embodying a "hand-holding but not opinionated" approach. The interface must feel intelligent and responsive, guiding the user without restricting their workflow.

### **6.2. Visual Style: Glassmorphism**

We will adopt the **Glassmorphism** design trend to create a sleek, futuristic, and visually hierarchical interface. This style uses a frosted-glass effect to make UI elements like cards, modals, and sidebars appear as if they are floating over a vibrant background.\[85, 86, 87\]

* **Key Characteristics:**  
  * **Transparency & Background Blur:** The core of the effect. Use CSS backdrop-filter: blur(20px);.\[88\]  
  * **Multi-Layered Depth:** Elements will be layered to create a sense of space.  
  * **Vibrant Backgrounds:** Use colorful, abstract gradient backgrounds to make the frosted glass effect prominent.\[85\]  
  * **Subtle Borders:** A 1px light, semi-transparent border will be added to elements to mimic the edge of glass.\[85\]

### **6.3. Color Palette**

The palette will combine soft, muted tones for the UI elements with vibrant, energetic gradients for the backgrounds to maximize the Glassmorphism effect.\[89\]

* **Primary UI Colors (for text, icons, borders):**  
  * White: \#FFFFFF  
  * Light Grey: \#F3F4F6  
  * Medium Grey: \#6B7280  
  * Dark Grey (Text): \#1F2937  
* **Accent Color (for buttons, links, highlights):**  
  * Electric Blue: \#3B82F6  
* **RAG Status Colors:**  
  * Green (On Track): \#10B981  
  * Amber (At Risk): \#F59E0B  
  * Red (Off Track): \#EF4444  
* **Background Gradient Examples:**  
  * Aurora Borealis: A flowing gradient from \#3B82F6 (blue) to \#A855F7 (purple) to \#EC4899 (pink).  
  * Sunset Glow: A warm gradient from \#F59E0B (amber) to \#EF4444 (red).

### **6.4. Typography**

* **Headings:** Font: Inter, Weight: Bold  
* **Body Text:** Font: Inter, Weight: Regular  
* **UI Elements:** Font: Inter, Weight: Medium

### **6.5. Micro-interactions & Animations (Framer Motion)**

Micro-interactions should be subtle, purposeful, and delightful, providing immediate feedback to the user.\[90, 91\]

* **Button Hover/Click:** On hover, buttons will scale up slightly (1.05x). On click, they will scale down (0.95x) before returning to normal. Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-in-out.\[92\]  
* **Modal/Panel Entry:** Modals and side panels will slide in smoothly with a slight fade-in effect.  
* **Loading Indicators:** Use subtle, branded loading spinners or skeleton loaders. For longer processes, a progress bar will be used to show system status.\[93\]  
* **Task Completion:** When a user marks a final task in a list as complete, a small, celebratory animation (e.g., a burst of confetti) will appear, similar to Asana's approach, to add a human touch.\[90\]  
* **Form Validation:** Input fields will provide real-time feedback. A green checkmark will animate in for valid input; an invalid field will shake slightly with a red border.\[92\]

### **6.6. Workflow Adaptation**

The UI must dynamically adapt based on the selected project methodology.

* **Prince2 View:** The main navigation will feature terms like "Stages," "Project Board," and "PID." The dashboard will prominently display the Business Case and Risk Register.  
* **Agile View:** The navigation will use terms like "Sprints," "Backlog," and "Roadmap." The dashboard will default to the Kanban board and burndown charts.  
* **Initial Document Outline:** When a methodology is selected in the Genesis Wizard, the UI will display a clear, visual list of the documents that will be generated (e.g., "We will create: Project Initiation Document, Business Case, Risk Register...").

## **7\. Content Strategy**

### **7.1. User Onboarding**

* **Goal:** Guide new users to their "Aha\!" moment—successfully generating their first set of project documents—as quickly as possible.\[73\]  
* **Welcome Email Series:** A 3-part automated email series:  
  1. **Welcome & Verification:** Confirms sign-up and provides a single, clear call-to-action: "Create Your First Project."  
  2. **Getting Started:** Sent 1 day later, highlights a key feature (e.g., the AI Chat) with a short GIF tutorial.  
  3. **Resources:** Sent 3 days later, links to the knowledge base and invites them to a bi-weekly "Getting Started" webinar.\[72\]  
* **In-App Onboarding:**  
  * An interactive product tour (using a tool like Userpilot) for the first session, guiding users through the Project Genesis Wizard.  
  * An onboarding checklist with a progress bar to encourage completion of key setup steps (e.g., "Create Project," "Invite Team Member," "Add First Task").\[94\]

### **7.2. Help Documentation**

* **Knowledge Base:** A comprehensive, searchable help center containing:  
  * **Q\&A Articles:** Answering common user questions.  
  * **Step-by-Step Guides:** Detailed instructions for all features, enhanced with screenshots and short videos.\[72\]

## **9\. Security Requirements**

### **9.1. Authentication & Authorization**

* **Authentication:** Handled by Supabase Auth. All sensitive actions will require an authenticated session.  
* **Authorization:** Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) will be strictly enforced on all database tables. Policies will ensure that users can only read/write data associated with projects they are explicitly members of.\[71\]

### **9.2. Data Handling & Environment Variables**

* **Client-Server Boundary:** A strict separation will be maintained. No sensitive data (API keys, secrets, database connection strings) will ever be passed to client components.\[99, 100\]  
* **Environment Variables:**  
  * All sensitive keys will be stored as server-side environment variables (e.g., SUPABASE\_SERVICE\_ROLE\_KEY). They will **NEVER** be prefixed with NEXT\_PUBLIC\_.\[99\]  
  * Public, non-sensitive keys (e.g., Supabase URL, Anon Key) will use the NEXT\_PUBLIC\_ prefix.  
  * .env.local will be used for local development secrets and will be included in .gitignore.

### **9.3. API & Database Security**

* **Input Validation:** All user input, especially data submitted via forms or Server Actions, will be rigorously validated on the server-side using a library like Zod before being processed or inserted into the database.\[100, 101\]  
* **Secure Database Queries:** All database queries will use parameterized statements (as is default with the Supabase client) to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.\[101\]  
* **CORS:** API routes will have a strict Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy, allowing requests only from the application's own domain.\[101\]  
* **Rate Limiting:** API endpoints will be rate-limited to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.\[101\]

---
