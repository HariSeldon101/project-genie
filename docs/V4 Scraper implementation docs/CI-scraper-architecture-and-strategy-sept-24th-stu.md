# Company Intelligence Scraper Architecture & Strategy
## Maximizing Commercial Intelligence Extraction

*Date: September 24, 2025*
*Version: 1.0*
*Objective: Align v4 scraper implementation with comprehensive commercial intelligence gathering*

---

## Executive Summary

Our current v4 scraping implementation is operating at approximately 20% of its potential capacity for commercial intelligence gathering. We're using scrapers as simple content extractors when they should be functioning as comprehensive business intelligence engines. This document outlines the full capabilities of our scraping tools and provides a strategic roadmap to extract maximum commercial value from target companies' digital presence.

**Key Finding**: We can extract 25+ distinct intelligence categories instead of our current 5, enabling comprehensive competitive analysis, market positioning assessment, and strategic insights generation.

## 4. Implementation Gap Analysis

### Critical Missing Features

#### 4.1 UI/UX Gaps
- ❌ **No extraction schema configuration** - Users can't define what to extract
- ❌ **No intelligence category selection** - Can't choose which types to gather
- ❌ **No depth level control** - Can't choose between quick/deep analysis
- ❌ **No pattern library** - Can't leverage common extraction patterns
- ❌ **No competitive focus mode** - Can't specifically target competitive intelligence

#### 4.2 Technical Gaps
- ❌ **transformToCategories() too simplistic** - Only creates 2 categories
- ❌ **No LLM schema usage** - Not using Firecrawl's most powerful feature
- ❌ **No Playwright interactions** - Not handling dynamic content
- ❌ **No content classification** - Not categorizing by business value
- ❌ **No pattern recognition** - Not identifying common structures

#### 4.3 Data Structure Gaps
- ❌ **Flat data structure** - Not hierarchical by intelligence type
- ❌ **No metadata preservation** - Losing context during extraction
- ❌ **No relationship mapping** - Not connecting related data points
- ❌ **No confidence scoring** - Not rating extraction quality
- ❌ **No source attribution** - Not tracking where data came from

## 5. Strategic Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1)
**Objective**: Enable structured extraction

1. **Implement extraction schemas**
   ```typescript
   // Add to scraper-controls-refactored.tsx
   const EXTRACTION_SCHEMAS = {
     corporate: corporateSchema,
     product: productSchema,
     competitive: competitiveSchema,
     // ... other schemas
   }
   ```

2. **Update transformToCategories()**
   ```typescript
   function transformToCategories(result: ScrapingResult): CategoryTree {
     return {
       corporate: extractCorporateIntelligence(result),
       products: extractProductIntelligence(result),
       market: extractMarketIntelligence(result),
       content: extractContentIntelligence(result),
       social: extractSocialProof(result),
       technical: extractTechnicalIntelligence(result),
       // ... all 25+ categories
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Add intelligence depth selector**
   ```typescript
   enum IntelligenceDepth {
     QUICK = 'quick',      // 5-10 pages, basic extraction
     STANDARD = 'standard', // 25-50 pages, structured extraction
     DEEP = 'deep',        // 100+ pages, full analysis
