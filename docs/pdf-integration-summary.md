# PDF Integration Summary

## âœ… Integration Complete

The new styled PDF generation system has been successfully integrated with the existing document download functionality.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Missing Export Error**: Added `pageStyles` export to `/lib/pdf/core/pdf-styles.ts`
2. **Async Function Issue**: Changed `generateStyledPDF` from async to sync function since PDF generation is synchronous
3. **Integration Point**: Connected `DirectPDFDownloadButton` component with new `generateStyledPDF` function

## How to Test

1. **Test Page Available**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000/test-pdf
2. **Click "Download Styled PDF"** button to generate a test PID document
3. **Check the PDF** for:
   - Professional cover page with metadata
   - Table of contents
   - Styled sections with proper formatting
   - Tables with alternating row colors
