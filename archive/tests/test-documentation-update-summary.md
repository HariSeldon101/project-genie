## New UI Elements Tested

### 1. SSE Streaming
- Verifies Accept header includes 'text/event-stream'
- Tests incremental page updates during discovery
- Validates phase events (start/complete)
- Checks TreeView updates dynamically

### 2. Filter Buttons
- Blog chip selection and notification
- Services chip selection and notification
- About chip selection and notification
- Toast notification count verification

### 3. Validation Phase
- Spinner animation detection
- "Validating X pages..." message
- Validation complete notification

### 4. Persistent Notifications
- Phase-specific toast messages
- Notification type verification (info/success)
- Notification list persistence
- Message content validation

### 5. Tooltips
- Button tooltip presence
- Chip tooltip presence
- TreeView control tooltips
- Tooltip content helpfulness

## Development Process Integration

### Mandatory Testing Workflow:
1. **Pre-commit**: Run `npm run test:ui` for quick UI tests
2. **Pre-push**: Run `npm run test:all` for comprehensive tests
3. **CI/CD**: Full test suite including visual regression
4. **Manual Testing**: Use `npm run test:ui:manual` for interactive testing

### Testing Requirements (Now Mandatory):
- All new UI elements MUST have corresponding tests
- Run tests before each commit (pre-commit hook)
- Run comprehensive tests before push (pre-push hook)
- Test coverage must not decrease below current level
- All interactive elements must have tooltip tests
- SSE streaming functionality must be tested
- Filter button functionality must be tested
- Notification persistence must be verified

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Run UI tests
npm run test:ui

# Run UI tests in manual mode (for debugging)
npm run test:ui:manual

# Run Playwright E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Open Playwright UI
npm run test:e2e:ui

# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Watch mode for continuous testing
npm run test:watch
```

## Next Steps

1. **Set up Git Hooks**:
   - Configure pre-commit hook to run `npm run test:ui`
   - Configure pre-push hook to run `npm run test:all`

2. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - Include test results in PR checks

3. **Visual Regression Testing**:
   - Add screenshot comparison tests
   - Set up baseline images

4. **Performance Testing**:
   - Add metrics for page load times
   - Monitor memory usage during research

## Success Metrics

- ✅ All new UI features have comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Testing is documented as mandatory in PROJECT_MANIFEST.json
- ✅ Test commands are easily accessible via npm scripts
- ✅ Documentation is up-to-date and comprehensive
- ✅ All test files are updated with new test scenarios

## Conclusion

The testing infrastructure has been successfully updated to comprehensively test all new UI elements. Testing is now a mandatory part of the development process, ensuring that any future changes maintain the high quality and functionality of the Company Intelligence feature.
