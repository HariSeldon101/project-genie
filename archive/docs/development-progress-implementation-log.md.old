- **Scale**: Batch processing up to 20 pages simultaneously

## v6.4 - Intelligent Multi-Phase Scraping Strategy Design
**Date: 2025-09-06**
**Timestamp: 13:15 GMT**

### Strategic Analysis & Documentation:
Successfully designed an ultra-smart multi-phase scraping strategy that addresses current performance issues and provides a path to 3x faster scraping with better accuracy.

### Key Insights Discovered:
1. **Current Issues**:
   - Binary scraper selection (Cheerio OR Playwright, never both)
   - Sequential processing taking 56-58 seconds for 12 pages
   - No validation of Cheerio results before proceeding
   - Over-use of Playwright for sites that are partially static

2. **Strategic Solution - Multi-Phase Approach**:
   - **Phase 1**: Rapid Cheerio scrape (all pages, parallel) - 5-10 seconds
   - **Phase 2**: Content validation & gap analysis - <1 second
   - **Phase 3**: Selective Playwright enhancement (only failed pages) - 10-15 seconds
   - **Phase 4**: Progressive result streaming to UI

3. **Intelligent Scraper Selection Criteria**:
   - Enhanced detection beyond simple framework detection
   - Page-level decisions instead of site-level
   - Validation-based fallback to Playwright
   - Parallel hybrid processing for mixed sites

### Documentation Created:
- `/docs/intelligent-multi-phase-scraping-strategy.md` - Comprehensive strategy guide
- Builds upon existing `/discovery-phase-improvement-plan.md`
- Integrates with Phase 1 Page Intelligence implementation

### Performance Improvements Designed:
- **Current**: 56-58 seconds (sequential, single scraper)
- **Optimized**: 15-20 seconds (parallel, hybrid approach)
- **Improvement**: 3x faster with better accuracy

### Implementation Strategy:
1. **Quick Wins** (15 mins):
   - Parallel Cheerio processing (5 pages at once)
   - Reduce inter-request delay to 500ms
   - Increase test timeout to 120s

2. **Smart Selection** (30 mins):
   - Implement content validation after Cheerio
   - Add selective Playwright for failed pages
   - Create hybrid scraping mode

3. **Progressive Enhancement** (45 mins):
   - Stream results as they arrive
   - Background enhancement with Playwright
   - Add caching layer for repeated structures

### Key Decision Tree Enhancement:
```
Cheerio First → Validate → Enhance if Needed → Stream Results
```
Instead of:
```
Detect Framework → Choose One Scraper → Wait for All → Show Results
```

### Next Steps:
- Implement parallel Cheerio scraping
- Add content validation layer
- Create selective Playwright enhancement
- Add progressive result streaming
- **Session Management**: Complete session tracking with metrics and statistics
- **Extensive Logging**: Comprehensive logging with permanentLogger integration
- **Test Coverage**: Full test suite with 5 real websites demonstrating functionality

### Test Results (All Passed):
- **BigFluffy.ai**: Homepage (70% confidence), 3 JSON-LD blocks, full meta data
- **Stripe.com**: Homepage (50.9% confidence), Organization data, extensive content signals
- **GitHub.com**: Homepage (45.3% confidence), comprehensive meta data
- **Airbnb.com**: Homepage (70% confidence), structured data extraction
- **Shopify.com**: Homepage (50.9% confidence), pricing signals detected
- **Sitemap Intelligence**: 95-100% confidence for standard page type classification

### Architecture Benefits:
- **Discovery Phase Enhancement**: Pre-classifies pages before detailed scraping
- **Resource Optimization**: Focus scraping on high-value pages based on type
- **Intelligence Insights**: Rich metadata and structured data for better analysis
- **Extensible Design**: Foundation for future intelligence enhancements
- **Performance**: Optimized batch processing for large sitemaps

---

## v4.3 - Critical Fix: Removed CompanyResearchOrchestrator
**Date: 2025-09-05**
**Timestamp: 17:42 GMT**

### Critical Issue Fixed:
- CompanyResearchOrchestrator was automatically running ALL phases (scraping → enrichment → generation)
- This was causing unauthorized LLM calls during enrichment phase
- Review gates were auto-proceeding without user approval

### Files Deleted:
- `/lib/company-intelligence/core/orchestrator.ts` - Contained the problematic CompanyResearchOrchestrator
- `/app/api/company-intelligence/stage-review/route.ts.backup.*` - 4 backup files with old references
- `/tests/integration/company-intelligence-api.test.ts` - Test file referencing old orchestrator

### Key Improvements:
- **STOPPED unauthorized LLM calls** - CompanyResearchOrchestrator no longer exists
- **Enforced phase separation** - Only PhaseOrchestrator remains for proper phase control
- **User approval required** - Each phase now requires explicit user action
- **Cleaner codebase** - Removed all legacy orchestrator code

### Result:
- LLM calls during Company Intelligence now ONLY happen when user explicitly approves enrichment/generation phases
- No more automatic progression through phases
- Complete control returned to user

## v5.1 - Technology Detection Accuracy Improvements
**Date: 2025-09-05**
**Timestamp: 22:30 GMT**

  - Per-page scraping progress
  - Success/failure metrics
  - Error stack traces
- Added emoji indicators for visual clarity (🕷️ for start, ✅ for success, ❌ for failure)
- Added data size metrics (KB downloaded, avg page size)

#### 3. Fixed TreeView Selection (100% Complete)
- Changed auto-select from "high priority pages" to "first 10 pages"
- Fixed "Select All" to properly handle all pages (with max limit warning)
- Added logging for all selection events
- Improved user feedback with better toast messages

#### 4. Fixed SiSegment Import (100% Complete)
