   - **Mac**: `Cmd + Shift + R`
3. Try creating a project and generating documents again

#### Option 2: Incognito/Private Window
1. Open a new Incognito/Private browsing window
2. Go to: https://project-genie-hariseldon101s-projects.vercel.app
3. Log in and try generating documents

#### Option 3: Clear Browser Cache Completely

## What Was Fixed

### Bug #1: Undefined Logger Import
**File:** `lib/documents/two-stage-generator.ts`

**Problem:**
```typescript
// WRONG - causes crash
import { logger } from '../utils/permanent-logger'
logger.info('RESEARCH', '...') // ❌ logger is undefined!
```

**Fix:**
```typescript
// CORRECT - now works
import { permanentLogger } from '../utils/permanent-logger'
permanentLogger.info('RESEARCH', '...') // ✅ Works!
```

**Error Message:**
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'info')
```

### Bug #2: Data Loss (Bonus Fix)
**Files:** Multiple

**Problem:**
- Agilometer settings (Hybrid) were completely lost
- PRINCE2 role hierarchy was partially lost
- Data reconstruction didn't match wizard structure

**Fix:**
- Added database columns: `agilometer`, `prince2_roles`
- Created data mapper for consistent structure
- All wizard data now preserved

## If the Error Persists

If you still see the error after clearing cache:

### 1. Check Browser Console
Look for this specific error:
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'info')
```

### 2. Check Network Tab
- Open Dev Tools (F12)
- Go to Network tab
- Try generating documents
- Check the `/api/generate` request
- Look at the Response tab for the full error

### 3. Verify Vercel Deployment
Go to: https://vercel.com/hariseldon101s-projects/project-genie

Check that the latest deployment (SHA: 24a35ac) is active.

### 4. Check for Server-Side Errors
The fix addressed client-side logger imports. If the error persists, it might be:
- A different file with the same bug
- A database connectivity issue
- An environment variable problem

---

## Need Help?

If the error continues after following all steps above:

1. Take a screenshot of:
   - The error message
   - Browser console (F12 → Console tab)
   - Network tab showing the failed request

2. Check Vercel logs for server-side errors

3. Verify you're not using an outdated project (created before the fix)

---

## Success Criteria

✅ **Fix is working if:**
- Document generation completes without errors
- No "Cannot read properties of undefined" errors
- All methodology types work (Agile, PRINCE2, Hybrid)
- Page refresh doesn't break the flow
- All wizard data is preserved in database
